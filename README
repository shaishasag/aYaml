argumentedYaml adds some functionality to PyYaml:
Methods isScalar(), isSequence(), isMapping() for easier identification of ScalarNode
    SequenceNode, MappingNode.
Method __len__ returns the number of items in value.
Method __iter__ implement iteration on value, ScalarNode is than pretending to be 
    a list of 1; For mapping there is also iterkeys to iterate on the list of keys.
Method __getitem__ implements [] access, again ScalarNode is pretending to be 
    a list of 1
Method __contains__ for MappingNode, to implement 'is in ...'
For writing Yaml to text:
Method writeAsYaml implements writing Yaml text, with proper indentation, for python 
    basic data types: tuple, list; If tags and comments are needed, YamlDumpWrap
    can be used to wrap other data types.  YamlDumpDocWrap adds tags and comments to 
    a whole document. Object that are not basic or YamlDumpWrap, can implement
    repr_for_yaml method to properly represent them selves for yaml writing.
